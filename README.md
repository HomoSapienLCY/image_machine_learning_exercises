During the implementation, thus thanks in advance

The accuracies on the Cifar-10 dataset matches the numbers in the paper.

On the BreakHis dataset, the accuracy is ~94% on 30% testing data.

To run a model on the BreakHis dataset:
- 1 download the BreakHis dataset and put it in a folder in the location ../Datasets
- 2 bash run_Net.sh

To run the Cifar-10 dataset:
- 1 download the Cifar-10 dataset and put it in a folder in the location ../Datasets
- 2 python Cifar_Main.py *initial learning rate* 1
